# Coffee-Shop-C-Sharp-Project

## Project Description :

In this project, I designed and developed software components in DLL form that provides 
useful business logics and functions as middleware objects.

Developed the program using Microsoft Visual Studio C# development tool. 
The software components have documented and 
tested using Microsoft Visual Studio C# Web GUI .

This project is based on database which called “coffeee shop database” . I implemented a 
web application to display all the employee details from the coffee shop database as a first part 
of the project. I have used Visual Studio C# as a language to implement DLL file and the web 
application to test the DLL file.


Here is the final output.
